# Personnal Crawler

I use this programm to give me an REST api/website homepage for the various sites that I read
Crawl every x min for the informations

Launching the program will create a webserver running on port 8086, I use it in synergy
with nginx to provide an homepage from my server

- What to expect:
    - track torrents (ShowRss)
    - track Youtube channel (API v3)
    - track SubReddit 
    - track weather (from openweathermap)
    - track anime (from haruhichan)
    - track Twitter (directly in the homepage)

- What to expect next: (maybe)
    - tracking of looking for group
    - tracking of a 4chan thread
    - Add a one shot mode (for an usage with cron)
