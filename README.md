# Personnal Crawler

I use this programm to give me an REST api for the different site that I follow
I will automatically every 2 hour refresh every information

Launching the program will create a webserver running on port 8086, I use it in synergy 
with nginx to offer an API from my server

I use firefox and a custom greasemonkey script to prettify the API :)

- What to expect:
    - track torrents (from eztv)
    - track videocast (from youtube, dailymotion, allocine)
    - track weather (from openweathermap)

- What to expect next: (maybe)
    - tracking of looking for group
    - tracking of a 4chan thread
    - Add a one shot mode (for an usage with cron)
